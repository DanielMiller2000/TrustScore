    Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural 
    intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of 
    intelligent agents: any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its 
    chance of achieving its goals. AI applications include advanced robotics, machine learning, and 
    language processing systems. Researchers continue to explore ways to create systems that are both 
    autonomous and capable of learning from data inputs.
