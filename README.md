## How It Works

1. **Upload Your Notes or Texts**  
   Drop your files (PDFs, Word documents, or plain text) or paste your content directly into the platform. The AI automatically scans and processes the text to extract key information.

2. **AI Analysis and Summarization**  
   The AI breaks down complex material into digestible summaries. It segments lengthy content into manageable sections, ensuring no critical information is lost. Summaries are generated in seconds, making it easy to review large volumes of text quickly.

3. **Generate Flashcards**  
   Using advanced NLP models, the AI identifies key concepts, terms, and ideas within the text. It then formulates questions and answers, turning them into flashcards that help with memorization and active recall.

4. **Engage with the Chatbot**  
   The AI-powered chatbot allows users to ask specific questions about the uploaded content. Whether clarifying concepts, testing understanding, or providing quizzes, the chatbot adapts to individual needs and provides instant responses.

5. **Track Progress and Improve**  
   The platform monitors your interactions, generating performance reports that highlight areas where improvement is needed. Adaptive learning paths are suggested based on your progress, helping you focus on weak points and master topics more effectively.

6. **Access Offline Mode**  
   Download and sync study materials to access them offline. This ensures learning continuity even without an internet connection, making it ideal for on-the-go studying.
